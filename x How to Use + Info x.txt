I tweaked Discordia theme to support GIF's and even transparent GIF's for Discord Icon  
I recommend getting your GIF link using GitHub  

— Create a public GitHub repo  

— Upload the GIF into it  

— Click the GIF file in the repo so you’re able to view it  

— Right click on the GIF preview and Open in New Tab  

— Copy the page link it should look like  
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOURGITHUBNAME/YOURREPONAME/refs/heads/main/NAMEOFYOURGIF.gif  

— Insert that link into the --custom-logo: url section of one of the TWEAKED Discordia theme files  

Enjoy your GIF Discord Icon!!
