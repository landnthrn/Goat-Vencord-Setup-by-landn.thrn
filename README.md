#### I tweaked Discordia theme to support GIF's and even transparent GIF's for Discord Icon  
I recommend getting your GIF link using github  

- Create a public github repo  

- Upload the GIF into it  

- Click the GIF file in the repo so your able to view it  

- Right click on the GIF preview and Open in New Tab  

- Copy the page link it should look like `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOURGITHUBNAME/YOURREPONAME/refs/heads/main/NAMEOFYOURGIF.gif`  

- Insert that link into the `--custom-logo:` url section of one of the TWEAKED Discordia theme files  

Enjoy your GIF Discord Icon!!
