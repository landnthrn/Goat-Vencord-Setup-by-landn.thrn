**My tweaked Discordia theme files also supports GIF's and even transparent GIF's as well** 
I recommend getting your GIF link using github,  

Create a public github repo  

Upload the GIF into it  

Click the GIF file in the repo so your able to view it  

Right click on the GIF preview and Open in New Tab  

Copy the page link it should look like "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YOURGITHUBNAME/YOURREPONAME/refs/heads/main/NAMEOFYOURGIF.gif"  

Insert that link into the --custom-logo: url section of one of the TWEAKED Discordia theme files  

Enjoy your GIF Discord Icon!!
